# market_impact

A python Package for fitting and calibrating master curves for nonlinear response functions using deep neural networks. 

Given an order of a particular type MO, LO, CA, QA that correpsonds to a market order, limit order, cancellation, and queues of active orders, 
we quantify the immediate and aggregate price and market impact of an order conditional on a particular order flow imbalance.
