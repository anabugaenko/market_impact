# market_impact

A python Package for fitting and calibrating master curves for nonlinear response functions. Given an order of a particular type MO, LO, CA, QA that correpsonds to a market order, limit order,
cancellation, and queues of active orders, we quantify the immediate and aggregate price and market impact of an order conditioned on order flow imbalance.
